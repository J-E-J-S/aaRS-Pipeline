## Introduction
Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases (aaRSs) are a class of enzyme central in translation,
facilitating the interaction of tRNAs to a cognate canonical amino acid (CAA).
To enable expansion of the natural chemical toolbox to incude non-canonical
amino acids (NCAAs), new enzymes of this class have to be enginereed to accept
the alternative chemistries offered by NCAAs, while remaining inert to
pre-existing CAAs.
