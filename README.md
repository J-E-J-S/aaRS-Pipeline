# aaRS Engineering Pipeline ðŸ§¬

## A Scalable Pipeline for the Discovery of aaRS Mutants to Aid in Genetic Code Expansion.

## Introduction
Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases (aaRSs) are a class of enzyme central to translation,
facilitating the interaction of tRNAs to a cognate canonical amino acid (CAA).
To enable expansion of the natural chemical toolbox to encompass non-canonical
amino acids (NCAAs), new enzymes of this class have to be enginereed to accept
the alternative chemistries offered by NCAAs, while remaining inert to
pre-existing CAAs.

## Workflow
The engineering workflow facilitates structure prediction of mutant enzymes
through [Rosetta Cartesian](https://www.rosettacommons.org/docs/latest/cartesian-ddG) energy minimization, followed by blind docking of
native and target (exogenous) amino acids by [CB-Dock](http://clab.labshare.cn/cb-dock/php/).
Mutants are then scored for fitness using the Delta and RMSD metrics.

## Scoring
**Delta:**
* Measures enzyme engineered favourability as: `NCAA Dock Score - Native Dock Score`
* Lower the score, the greater the engineered affinity for the NCAA over the
native substrate\  
**RMSD:**
* Estimation metric of the mutant producing a productive docking pose with the
target NCAA
* Root-Mean-Square Deviation of the exogenously docked NCAA to the crystal-structure
derived docking position of the native amino acid
* Lower the RMSD, the greater the mutant appears to dock the NCAA in a
productive binding pose.
